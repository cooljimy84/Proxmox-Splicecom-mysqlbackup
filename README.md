# ProxMox-Backup-MysqlContainer
So i have not used this on a live system yet, and it does drown my test box then the containers try to backup big databases.
You also need to make sure that the container has enough space to do the backup, as there is no checks.

I may, if i get time, attach a directory from the host to the container to store the backup, solving that problem.

You are free to use this program as is, but i do encorage you to fork it and improve it for all.
